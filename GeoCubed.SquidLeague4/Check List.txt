TODO:
Restructure the GeoCubed.SquidLeague4.Application project to move the Dtos into seperate models stored somewhere else
> Don't worry if I'm transfaring slightly more information in these models they should be general between everything so they can be esily edited.
> Each feature should have a request and a response obj the response obj should have a data obj with the return data in.
> The base response can be used for this. This way any further attributes can be added to specific cases

Restructure the website models to be better.
> Basically they're all over the place currently so...

Implement a proper audit system.
Implement a proper error message / reporting system.

Add more roles to users to determine what they can do e.g Can record games
Change the login system to use discord Oauth instead - and then I can validate all the users.
